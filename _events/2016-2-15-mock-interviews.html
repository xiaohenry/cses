excerpt: In order to help CSE students be ready for DeCAF, CSES will be holding a week of whiteboard interview sessions powered by the community. Students can sign up to be either an <em>interviewer or interviewee</em>. Signing up for <em>either</em> will qualify you for early access to DeCAF. We will do our best to accommodate everyone.
